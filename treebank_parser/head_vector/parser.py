	This class implements a parsing algorithm for CoNLLU-formatted files. It uses
	the modules `conllu.line_parser` and `conllu.line_type` to easily parse the
	file.
	
	This class basically implements the algorithms to convert each syntactic
	dependency tree into an object of type `lal.graphs.rooted_tree` and convert
	each tree into a head vector.
	
	This class also applies some preprocessing specified by the user via arguments
	(see main CLI).
