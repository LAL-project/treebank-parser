This is a helper module to make code more readable when classifying lines.

This module only has one method that returns the type of line among three different types:
- blank line
- comment line	
- word lines

See https://universaldependencies.org/format.html for more details on the type
of lines that a CoNLL-formatted text can have.

	Classifies the line passed as parameter.
	
	Parameters
	==========
	- line : the line to be classified. Must be a string type.
	
	Returns
	=======
	Returns the classification of the line as either:
		
	- blank   : for blank lines
	- comment : for comment lines
	- word    : for word lines

	Converts a line type to a string.
	
	Parameters
	==========
	- `t` : type of line. One of line_type.blank, line_type.comment, line_type.word.
	
	Returns
	=======
	Returns a string "blank", "comment", "word" dependening on the type.
	The type must be valid.
