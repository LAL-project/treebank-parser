r"""
This module encodes the types of actions that can be performed in the processing
of a CoNLL-U-formatted treebank.

Each action is performed on every syntactic dependency tree.

Action types
============
- `RemovePunctuationMarks` : remove punctuation signs
- `RemoveFunctionWords` : remove function words

Actions can be retrieved as 'key' strings for the command line interface,
and also as 'help' strings with a self explanatory message (useful for,
    e.g., error messages, help messages from command line).

Members of this module
======================
- `action_key_str`: a dictionary relating each action type (listed above) with
a so-called `key` string. These are particularly useful to design the command
line interface so that users can pass actions as parameters.
- `action_help_str`: a dictionary relating each action type (listed above) with
a so-called `help` string. These strings are more useful in displaying messages
on the command line for users to read.
